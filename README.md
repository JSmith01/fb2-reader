# Web FB2 Reader

This is a project to be able to read FB2 files using web browser only,
including ones inside `zip` archives.

Ideally it should work completely offline.

Reader is partially based on XSL derived from [fb2any](https://github.com/gribuser/fb2any)
tool by [gribuser](https://github.com/gribuser).
